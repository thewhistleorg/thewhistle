<h1>Submit your report</h1>

<p>To collect eyewitness reports on the situation in X, ABC NGO is using The Whistle, a digital
    reporting platform for witnesses of human rights violations based at the University of
    Cambridge.</p>
<p>Your eyewitness reports are very valuable to us. Before we are able to act on any information,
    including yours, we must verify it. This allows the information to stand up in the courts of law
    and public opinion.</p>
<p>This reporting platform will prompt you to supply a variety of information that we need to verify
    your report. It will ask for you to enter information over a few pages that correspond to the
    four key questions that must be answered to verify information: What, Where, When, and Who.
    Please fill out as much as you know and is safe.</p>
