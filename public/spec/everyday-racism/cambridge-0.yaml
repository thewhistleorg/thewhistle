    # Before you start...
    By completing this incident report form you are taking part in an independent research project developed by Dr Ella McPherson and Dr MÃ³nica Moreno Figueroa based at the Department of Sociology, University of Cambridge.

      * The project has two main aims: to provide useful data to push for institutional change and to test reporting technology for advocacy research.
      * Your report will help us understand how racism is experienced at Cambridge with numeric, descriptive and geographic evidence to inform advocacy but also for academic presentations and publications.
      * Your report will help us generate weekly and monthly reports to inform the work of student and staff antiracist activism in the University pushing the agenda for institutional change.
      * This project has gone through a consultation process with various organisations and individuals within and outside Cambridge who have reviewed the report and given us feedback. Amongst our supporters are [**UCU Cambridge Branch**](http://www.ucu.cam.ac.uk/), [**Cambridge University Student Union and Graduate Union**](https://www.cusu.co.uk/), [**FLY**](https://www.facebook.com/FLYcambridge/), [**The Black Cantabs Research Society**](https://www.blackcantabs.org/), [**The 1752 Group**](https://1752group.com/) and the [**Decolonising Sociology Committee**](https://decolonisesociology.wordpress.com/).
      * As researchers, we are trained in keeping data confidential. We will preserve your confidentiality and keep the raw data safely stored. Your whole anonymous report will only be seen by staff and volunteers of The Whistle/Everyday Racism project at the University of Cambridge. We adhere to the code of ethics of the British Sociological Association: [**https://www.britsoc.co.uk/ethics**](https://www.britsoc.co.uk/ethics).
      * This report should take around 15 minutes to complete, but this might vary. Thank you for taking the time.
