Anonymous aliases
======

For some use-cases it can be useful for admins to see which reports have been submitted by the same user. In order to keep reports anonymous, by default we do not store any personal information. To avoid dehumanising reporters, we decided not to assign them with reporter numbers, but instead to use anonymous aliases to link reports. These aliases comprise two words, where the first word is a tree, fruit, herb, flower or mineral and the second word is a landscape.
