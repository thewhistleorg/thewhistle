    # Racist Incident

    We understand this can be difficult. Please take your time and tell us as much as you want about what happened to you or the person you are writing it about. Support services are available for you, and a list of those can be found at the end of the reporting form or in our website here: [http://racismatcambridge.org/further-support/](http://racismatcambridge.org/further-support/).

    You can also report an incident you witnessed even if you were not asked to do so. You will have the opportunity to write about this circumstance at the end of the report.

    Experiences of racism can be so ordinary that it might be difficult to isolate particular incidents. In this report we are aiming to capture different ‘types’ (from the more subtle and everyday to the most obvious and deliberate) and frequencies of forms of racism. We are calling them ‘incidents’ although we are aware this term might limit the complex forms in which racism is expressed and experienced. 

    You will have the option to add different incidents under this same report or create a new one. You can write about a cluster of incidents that are similar in nature, if they have happened in the same place and with the same people. If there are variations and differences, please register each incident separately.
    
    You will be able to create and download a PDF with your information.
