- text: For the questions on this page, if you are reporting on behalf of someone else who has shared their experience with you or if you are reporting about an incident that you witnessed, please describe yourself, the reporter.

- text: 'Please help us to better understand how you might have experienced this incident by answering the following questions. While we understand that some of these details are socially constructed as well as the object of academic and political debate, we are interested in providing data that can more easily speak to public policy bodies and institutional change. We think that the power of every personâ€™s experiences of racism will be more strongly represented with the aid of the profiles of the individuals that these incidents are happening to.'
