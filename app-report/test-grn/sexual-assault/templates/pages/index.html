    <p class="special-intro">This is a safe and anonymous way to report something that has
        happened to you or someone you know. This is not for ongoing emergencies.</p>
    <ul class=" with-margin">
        <li>You are free to tell us as little or as much as you are comfortable with.</li>
        <li>Your report will only be seen by staff and volunteers of Global Rights Nigeria
            assessing the report.</li>
        <li>We only want to know what happened, not your identity.</li>
        <li>This should take less than 10 minutes.</li>
