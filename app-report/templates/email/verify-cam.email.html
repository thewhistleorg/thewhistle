    <title>End Everyday Racism Email Verification</title>

<body>
    <p>Hello!</p>

    <p>Thank you so much for your interest in reporting an incident of racism to the End Everyday Racism project.</p>
    
    <p>Your authentication code is <strong>{{ verificationCode }}</strong>. This code helps us verify that you are a member of the Cambridge community. Since we do not store your email address, you will need to generate a new authentication code every time you submit a report.</p>
    
    <p>Your alias is <strong>{{ alias }}</strong>. You can use this alias to report multiple incidents. That lets us know that a set of reports all come from the same source.</p>
    
    <p>Thank you again for participating in this project.</p>
    
    <p>End Everyday Racism Team</p>
