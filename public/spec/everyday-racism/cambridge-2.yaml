                    name: anonymous
                    type: checkbox

                        confirm:
                            label: If you have concerns that providing detailed information might lead to your being identified, please note that we take the protection of your identity very seriously. We are also careful about collecting data pertaining only to members of the University of Cambridge. You will be asked to verify your link to the university by providing a current or alumni email address, to which an email will be sent that verifies your email address and gives you access to the report. After you do this, we will not keep your email and have no way to link it to your identity. The report will generate an alias which you must safeguard if you want to log into your report and add an incident to your file. You will also have the opportunity to create and download a PDF with your report at the end after you submit it. For our purposes, we will use your data by aggregating and crossing the details so your profile and report cannot be put together unless you explicitly ask for it using your alias.
