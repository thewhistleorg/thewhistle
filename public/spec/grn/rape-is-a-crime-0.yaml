    This is a safe and anonymous way to report something that has happened to you or someone you
    know. If you are experiencing an emergency right now, please use WhatsApp to contact *Rape is a
    Crime* for an immediate response: 0811-888-4144.
    - You are free to tell us as little or as much as you are comfortable with.
    - Your report will only be seen by staff and volunteers of Global Rights Nigeria assessing the
      report.
    - Please be aware that although we take all the precautions we can to protect information, your keyboard could be tracked by a keylogger. Using either anti-virus or anti-keylogger software can help to mitigate this risk.
    - We only want to know what happened, not your identity.
    - This should take less than 10 minutes.
