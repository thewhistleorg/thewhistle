<h1>E-mail verification test</h1>

<p>An e-mail has been sent to {{email}} with a link to verify your e-mail address.</p>

<p>Once you have verified your e-mail address, we can act on your report.</p>

<p>Note that we do not store your e-mail address, so we will not be able to contact you. We do store
    an encrypted hash of your e-mail, so that we can confirm your identity if you wish to contact us
    again.</p>
