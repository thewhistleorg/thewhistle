    Tell us as little or as much as you feel comfortable doing.

    **We want to know what the racist incident was and how and where it happened.  As this is not a formal university reporting procedure, we do not wish to know your identity or the identity of others involved; be mindful that your identity may be discoverable through other data such as location data. You will not be named in public documents or presentations. There will be no formal responses for any individuals involved, as this is a research and advocacy project.**

    _Please be aware that this is not a formal reporting procedure of the University of Cambridge. You may learn more about specific reporting procedures for staff and students [**here**](https://www.race-equality.admin.cam.ac.uk/help-and-advice)._ This project, End Everyday Racism at Cambridge, differs from the anonymous reporting that the University offers because we want more detail about the nature of the event that took place as well as the location and because our aim is to highlight how racism is normalised. Our anonymous reporting tool is not actionable in individual termsâ€”no action will be taken to address this specific instance of racism you report, because the university cannot identify any individuals or location.

    If you are experiencing a crisis and need medical attention, call 111. We understand the difficult relationship between people of colour and the police but please note you could decide to report a hate crime at 999 or [http://report-it.org.uk/your_police_force](http://report-it.org.uk/your_police_force) or reach out to organizations such as [http://www.stophateuk.org/](http://www.stophateuk.org/) and [http://www.report-it.org.uk/organisations_that_can_help](http://www.report-it.org.uk/organisations_that_can_help).

    Please take care of yourself, reach out if you are struggling and try and find support from people you trust if you can.
