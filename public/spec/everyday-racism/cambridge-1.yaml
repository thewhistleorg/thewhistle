    Tell us as little or as much as you feel comfortable doing.

    **We want to know what, how and where the racist incident happened, not your identity, even if your identity may be discoverable through other data such as location data. You will not be named in public documents or presentations. There will be no formal repercussions for any specific person, either the one who reports or if there is anyone in particular being reported as this is a research project and not a formal reporting university procedure.**

    _Please be aware that this is not a formal reporting procedure of the University of Cambridge. You may also wish to make a report using the University of Cambridge official reporting procedures [**here**](https://www.studentcomplaints.admin.cam.ac.uk/harassment-sexual-misconduct/reporting-harassment-bullying-discrimination-or-sexual-misconduct) or through its [**anonymous reporting procedure**](https://www.studentcomplaints.admin.cam.ac.uk/anonymous-reporting-harassment-hate-crime-sexual-misconduct)._ This project, End Everyday Racism at Cambridge, differs from the anonymous reporting that the University offers because it wants more detail about the nature of the event that took place as well as the location and its aim is to highlight how racism is normalised. This anonymous reporting tool is not actionable in individual termsâ€”no action will be taken to address this specific instance of racism, because the university cannot identify any individuals or location.

    If you are experiencing a crisis and need medical attention, call 111. We understand the difficult relationship between people of colour and the police but please note you could decide to report a hate crimes at 999 or [http://report-it.org.uk/your_police_force](http://report-it.org.uk/your_police_force) or reach out to organizations such as [http://www.stophateuk.org/](http://www.stophateuk.org/) and [http://www.report-it.org.uk/organisations_that_can_help](http://www.report-it.org.uk/organisations_that_can_help).

    Please take care of yourself, reach out if you are struggling and try and find support from people you trust if you can.
