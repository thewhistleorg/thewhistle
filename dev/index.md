The Whistle Development Notes
=============================

This section holds various notes documenting the development process, design decisions, etc.

## [README.md](/dev/notes/readme)

The GitHub README.md file, this gives an introduction to the system from a developers perspective,
and a technical overview of the system architecture. This may be of value in explaining the system
architecture to external partners, and as a starting point for new developers.

## [Development Workflow](/dev/notes/development-workflow)

The app is held in a GitHub repository for source code management and developer collaboration. These
notes set out in detail the developer workflow used in the project, in order that developers can
successfully collaborate on development. The notes also explain the use of continuous integration
tests, and review apps.

## [Database backups](/dev/notes/db-backups)

MongoDB database backup procedures.

## [Form generation wizard](/dev/notes/form-wizard)

The long-term objective is that incident report submission forms should be created by NGO staff with
potentially no technical expertise at all. These notes set out plans for this may be achieved.

## [Redgate down-tools week](/dev/notes/redgate-dtw)

Technical notes made during the Redgate down-tools week detailing the work done by Redgate staff,
and its inclusion in the app.

## [Technology Trial notes](/dev/notes/technology-trial-notes)

Early notes (from April 2017) intended to be a living document, but neglected since then. May now be
more useful to keep as a historical document than to use again as a living document?

## [Twilio](/dev/notes/twilio)

Very early notes (March 2017) documenting Twilio development.
