- text: '# What happened?'

- text: |
    Try to describe as much of what has happened as you can. You may wish to include what led up to the event or situation, as well as what happened and any subsequent events or implications. Please note that It makes it harder to use data if you use names of specific individuals. 

    If the incident you want to report was not ‘an act’ committed by a particular individual, but it refers to a more structural or diffuse experience (such as a hostile atmosphere or seeing a problematic image) please describe it here.
